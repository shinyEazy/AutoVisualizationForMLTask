About yumi : - love to sleep with ppl - she will keep on meowing if she's hugry - very2 active, always seeking for people to accompany her playing - well trained (poo+pee in her own potty) - easy to bathing - I only feed her with these brands : IAMS, Kittenbites, Pro-formance Reason why i need someone to adopt Yumi: I just married and need to move to a new house where no pets are allowed :( As Yumi is very2 special to me, i will only give her to ppl that i think could take care of her just like i did (especially on her foods things)..",7d7a39d71,3.0,0,images/7d7a39d71-1.jpg
